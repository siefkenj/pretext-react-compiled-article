<div class="para">The back matter solutions appendix requests every <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;answer&gt;</code>, and only <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;answer&gt;</code>, of all types of exercises: inline, divisional, worksheet, reading questions, and projects.  Now, as observed by Bruce Yoshiwara, it gets a bit tedious to see the “Answer” heading over and over in print, when every entry has that heading.  So we squelch it for you in print/PDF output.  (For <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> output we use knowls and need to have something to click on.  But perhaps for <abbr class="initialism">EPUB</abbr> we should be more careful?)  Note that you might want to use a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;title&gt;</code>, or an <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;introduction&gt;</code>, that explains which component of the exercises is being displayed, so there is no confusion.</div>
