<div class="para">Some presentations can be assisted by a hint from the author about the lengths of the titles.  You can choose to provide a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">width</code> attribute on a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dl</code> element with possible values <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">narrow</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">medium</code>. The value refers (somewhat confusingly) to the distance between the left margin and the description.  The default is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">medium</code>, which is illustrated above. Conversion to <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> ignores the attribute.  An example with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">narrow</code>:</div>
