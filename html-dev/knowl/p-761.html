<div class="para">Tables are formed in <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> output with copious use of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\multicolumn</code> macro to override more global alignment settings, and to spread the content of one cell across several columns.  However, sometimes <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>’s special characters have behaved badly in this situation.  So the table below, two items per row, is just designed for <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> testing.  But of course, it should still render fine in other formats.  The three test cases are from <a href="text-in-paragraphs.html#section-urls" class="internal" title="Subsection 8.8: URLs, such as http://example.com">8.8</a>, but without 50 alphabetic characters and 8 digits, which should not be problems in this context.  In order to test the use of a percent sign (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">%</code>) in a URL, we follow it by two hex digits, specifically, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">58</code>, which is a way to represent the character <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">X</code> in a <abbr class="initialism">URL</abbr>.  The first column’s entries are <em class="emphasis">forced</em> to be wrapped in a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\multicolumn</code> by specifying their horizontal alignment.  The second column’s entries <em class="emphasis">will not</em> be wrapped in a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\multicolumn</code>.  So the two columns will look identical, other than the first having a left alignment, and the second has the default center alignment.  (This table is known to render poorly in a Jupyter notebook.  The cause is four dollar signs present in rows 1 and 3, and is explained in <a href="text-in-paragraphs.html#subsection-jupyter-dollars" class="internal" title="Subsection 8.12: Jupyter Notebook, Markdown, MathJax, Delimiters">Subsection 8.12</a>.)</div>
