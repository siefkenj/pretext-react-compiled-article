<div class="para">Our maximum width for text, designed for readability, suggests you should format your Sage code with a maximum of about 54 characters. On a mobile device, the number of displayed characters might be as low as 28 in portrait orientation, and again around 50 in landscape.  You can use a variety of techniques to shorten long lines, such as using intermediate variables.  Since Sage is just a huge Python library, you can use any of Pythonâ€™s facilities for handling long lines.  These include a continuation character (which I try to avoid using) or natural places where you can break long lines, such as between entries of a list.  Also, if writing loops or functions, you may wish to have your indentation be only two characters wide (rather than, say, four).</div>
