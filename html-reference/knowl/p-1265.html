<div class="para">A <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;tabular&gt;</code> realized by <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> for PDF/print will normally be as wide as necessary to hold the content, without word-wrapping the content of any cell that is not explicitly authored that way.  This is the most rigid of the content types we call “planar.”  So for PreTeXt output as <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>, when you explicitly constrain the width to be less than the “natural width” (including use as a panel of a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;sidebyside&gt;</code>, or even setting margins) the table will be scaled <em class="emphasis">down</em> in width, which can result in an apparent font size very much smaller than that of the surrounding text.  Note that we do not ever scale a tabular up to be wider with a larger font size.  Note also that if there is no attempt to control the space for the table (no layout control, not in a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;sidebyside&gt;</code>) then no scaling is attempted at all and the table may be wider than the text and protrude into the right margin.  For more, see the three examples at: <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/natural-too-wide.html" title="Table 28.25: Tabular too wide, no layout control">Table 28.25</a> , <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/scale-down-auto.html" title="Table 28.26: Tabular too wide, scale to automatic width">Table 28.26</a>, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/scale-down-100.html" title="Table 28.27: Tabular too wide, scale to 100% width">Table 28.27</a>.  Generally, much of the commentary and testing here is about <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>/PDF/print.  While for <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> output the cells will usually automatically word-wrap to fit in the available space, without adjusting the font size.  Some might like this behavior and some might not.</div>
