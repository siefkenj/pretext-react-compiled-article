<div class="para">Prime numbers were first studied by the ancient Greeks.  Two important results from antiquity are Euclid’s proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>  One problem in number theory is to find a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(n)\)</span> is prime for each integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Pierre Fermat (1601?–1665) conjectured that <span class="process-math">\(2^{2^n} + 1\)</span> was prime for all <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) that</div>

<div class="para">is a composite number. One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach’s Conjecture.  In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of 2 seemed to be the sum of two primes:  <span class="process-math">\(4 = 2 + 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(6 = 3 + 3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(8 =3 + 5\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{.}\)</span>  Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 10^{18}\text{,}\)</span> it has yet to be proven in general.  Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.</div>
