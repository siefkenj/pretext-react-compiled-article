<div class="para">Many of the groups discussed in this chapter are available for study in Sage.  It is important to understand that sets that form algebraic objects (groups in this chapter) are called “parents” in Sage, and elements of these objects are called, well, “elements.”  So every element belongs to a parent (in other words, is contained in some set).  We can ask about properties of parents (finite? order? abelian?), and we can ask about properties of individual elements (identity? inverse?).  In the following we will show you how to create some of these common groups and begin to explore their properties with Sage.</div>
