<div class="para">One method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a certain fixed positive integer <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is to list all of the numbers <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(1 \lt n \lt N\text{.}\)</span>  Begin by eliminating all of the multiples of 2.  Next eliminate all of the multiples of 3. Now eliminate all of the  multiples of 5.  Notice that 4 has already been crossed out.  Continue in this manner, noticing that we do not have to go all the way to <span class="process-math">\(N\text{;}\)</span> it suffices to stop at <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{N}\text{.}\)</span> Using this method, compute all of the prime numbers less than <span class="process-math">\(N = 250\text{.}\)</span>  We can also use this method to find all of the integers that are relatively prime to an integer <span class="process-math">\(N\text{.}\)</span>  Simply eliminate the prime factors of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> and all of their multiples.  Using this method, find all of the numbers that are relatively prime to <span class="process-math">\(N= 120\text{.}\)</span>  Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, write a program that will compute all of the primes less than an integer <span class="process-math">\(N\text{.}\)</span>
