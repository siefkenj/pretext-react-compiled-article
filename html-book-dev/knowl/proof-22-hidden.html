<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of Well-Ordering. Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> be a cyclic group generated by <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and suppose that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(H = \{ e \}\text{,}\)</span> then trivially <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is cyclic. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> contains some other element <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> distinct from the identity. Then <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> can be written as <span class="process-math">\(a^n\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a subgroup, <span class="process-math">\(g^{-1} = a^{n}\)</span> must also be in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span>  Since either <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(-n\)</span> is positive, we can assume that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> contains positive powers of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> be the smallest natural number such that <span class="process-math">\(a^m \in H\text{.}\)</span> Such an <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We claim that <span class="process-math">\(h = a^m\)</span> is a generator for <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span>  We must show that every <span class="process-math">\(h' \in H\)</span> can be written as a power of <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(h' \in H\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(h' = a^k\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Using the division algorithm, we can find numbers <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(k = mq +r\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq r \lt m\text{;}\)</span> hence,</div>

\begin{equation*}
