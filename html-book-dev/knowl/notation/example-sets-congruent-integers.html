<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> be two integers and suppose that <span class="process-math">\(n \in {\mathbb N}\text{.}\)</span>  We say that <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">congruent</dfn> to <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> <dfn class="terminology">modulo</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is congruent to <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> mod <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(r - s\)</span> is evenly divisible by <span class="process-math">\(n\text{;}\)</span> that is, <span class="process-math">\(r - s = nk\)</span>  for some <span class="process-math">\(k \in {\mathbb Z}\text{.}\)</span>  In this case we write <span class="process-math">\(r \equiv s \pmod{n}\text{.}\)</span>    For example, <span class="process-math">\(41 \equiv 17 \pmod{ 8}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(41 - 17=24\)</span> is divisible by 8.  We claim that congruence modulo <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> forms an equivalence relation of <span class="process-math">\({\mathbb Z}\text{.}\)</span>  Certainly any integer <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is equivalent to itself since <span class="process-math">\(r - r = 0\)</span> is divisible by <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>  We will now show that the relation is symmetric.  If <span class="process-math">\(r \equiv s \pmod{ n}\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(r - s = -(s -r)\)</span> is divisible by <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(s - r\)</span> is divisible by <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s \equiv r \pmod{ n}\text{.}\)</span>  Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(r \equiv s \pmod{ n}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s \equiv t \pmod{ n}\text{.}\)</span>  Then there exist integers <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(r -s = kn\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s - t = ln\text{.}\)</span>  To show transitivity, it is necessary to prove that <span class="process-math">\(r - t\)</span> is divisible by <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>  However,</div>

\begin{equation*}
