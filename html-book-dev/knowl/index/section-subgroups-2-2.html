<div class="para">Sometimes we wish to investigate smaller groups sitting inside a larger group.   The set of even integers <span class="process-math">\(2{\mathbb Z} = \{\ldots, -2, 0, 2, 4, \ldots \}\)</span> is a group  under the operation of addition. This smaller group sits naturally inside of the group of integers under addition.  We define a <dfn class="terminology">subgroup</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> of a group <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> to be a subset <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> such that when the group operation of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is restricted to <span class="process-math">\(H\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a group in its own right. Observe that every group <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> with at least two elements will always have at least two subgroups, the subgroup consisting of the identity element alone and the entire group itself. The subgroup <span class="process-math">\(H = \{ e \}\)</span> of a group <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is called the <dfn class="terminology">trivial subgroup</dfn>.  A subgroup that is a proper subset of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is called a <dfn class="terminology">proper subgroup</dfn>. In many of the examples that we have investigated up to this point, there exist other subgroups besides the trivial and improper subgroups.</div>
