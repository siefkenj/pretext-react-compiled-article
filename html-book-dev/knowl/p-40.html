<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">mathematical proof</dfn> is nothing more than a convincing argument about the accuracy  of a statement. Such an argument should contain enough detail to convince the audience; for instance, we can see that the statement “<span class="process-math">\(2x = 6\)</span> exactly when <span class="process-math">\(x = 4\)</span>” is false by evaluating <span class="process-math">\(2 \cdot 4\)</span> and noting that <span class="process-math">\(6 \neq 8\text{,}\)</span> an argument that would satisfy anyone. Of course, audiences may vary widely: proofs can be addressed to another student, to a professor, or to the reader of a text.  If more detail than  needed is presented in the proof, then the  explanation will be either long-winded or poorly written.  If too much detail is omitted, then the proof may  not be convincing.  Again it is important to keep the audience in mind.  High school students require much more detail than do graduate students.  A good rule of thumb for an argument in an introductory abstract algebra course is that it should be written to convince one’s peers, whether those peers be other students or other readers of the text.</div>
