To prove the third condition, let <span class="process-math">\(h \in H\text{.}\)</span>  Since <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a group, there is  an element <span class="process-math">\(h' \in H\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(hh' = h'h = e\text{.}\)</span>  By the uniqueness  of the inverse in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(h' = h^{-1}\text{.}\)</span>
